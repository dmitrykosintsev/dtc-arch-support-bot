## Problem statement
New Linux users often find it difficult to solve problems with software. There are many forums and wiki-websites. However, they contain a lot of information, which can be confusing. By using LLMs, we can provide a user-friendly and customisable response that will directly tackle the issues the user is facing. Arch-support-bot provides information based on the pages of Arch wiki, which is one of the biggest resources available for Linux users.
